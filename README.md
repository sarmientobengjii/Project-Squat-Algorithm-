# Project-Squat-Algorithm-

Squat Algorithm is an action-packed roguelite fitness game where players use real-life movements to unleash attacks on waves of enemies. By performing jabs, hooks, uppercuts, lateral raises, squats, lunges, hops, and side steps, players fire powerful projectiles. While the movements are challenging, even minimal effort can deliver full damage, making the game accessible yet physically engaging.

Players will encounter a variety of enemies, including treants, bats, and wolves. As they progress, they will face massive boss enemies like towering golems and armored giant beetles, which require strategy and agility to defeat.

Throughout the game, players will meet young Elemental Guardians, who bestow special elemental abilities. These powers enhance both attacks and defense, granting effects like Exploding Projectiles, Revenge Damage, Double Strike Chance, and debuffs such as Slow, Blind, or Paralyze. Elemental enhancements can also be applied to leg movements, such as performing dark-element squats or unleashing fire-boosted uppercuts.

With random enemy waves and evolving elemental abilities, Squat Hero offers a thrilling combination of fitness-based gameplay and strategic upgrades, challenging players to stay active and think on their feet as they battle through increasingly difficult foes.

Releasing for Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest Pro, Meta Quest 3, Meta Quest 3S in October.
